🏡 Blockchain-Based Land Registration System
📌 Overview

Land registration in India and many other parts of the world is traditionally a slow, paper-driven, and error-prone process. It suffers from challenges like fraudulent transactions, loss of paperwork, duplication of records, and lengthy court disputes.

This project leverages Blockchain Technology to build a decentralized and transparent Land Registration System. By using Ethereum smart contracts, every transaction made during the land buying process is stored on the blockchain, making it immutable, secure, and verifiable.

The system is designed to:

Accelerate land registration and verification.

Reduce fraud cases by ensuring tamper-proof records.

Provide trustless interactions between buyers, sellers, and government authorities.

Enable land ownership transfer in a transparent and efficient manner.
